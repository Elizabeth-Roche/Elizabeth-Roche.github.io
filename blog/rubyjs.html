      Debugging is an essential part of coding. Knowing where errors are and understanding what needs to be corrected will make life less frustrating for any coder. Ruby is excellent when it comes to error messages as we're able to gather a lot of information about the type of error as well as the location of the error.

     Debugging in JavaScript is a whole different story. Instead of getting helpful messages about the type of error, we mainly get syntax errors. These are not very helpful in that they are saying very broadly that our syntax is wrong in a certain line but not much else. If you've been working through trying to identify a syntax error in your JavaScript, then I'm sure you can understand the frustration. Because JavaScript is technically a less strict coding language, it may run code in a way you aren't intending it to be run. As a result, the error messages are quite broad as well.
