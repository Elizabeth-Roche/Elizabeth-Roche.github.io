      In September of 2015, Google changed it’s logo. Social media went crazy. Almost every major news outlet in the world reported on the new logo and publications like Forbes, The New Yorker, Fortune Magazine and Wired wrote lengthy articles discussing the merit of such a change. It seemed that everyone had an opinion about the new logo and the story occupied headlines for days. Meanwhile, brands like IHOP, KFC, Coors Light and Electrolux also updated their logos in 2015 without so much as a trending hashtag. Why am I commenting on logos? Because Google has infiltrated our lives and the headlines prove it - we care about Google. Whether you’re sharing documents in Drive, sending invites via GCal, or simply checking your Gmail account on your phone, you’re relying on one company’s code to complete your daily tasks.

        According to Google’s Rachel Potvin, all of Google’s Internet services run on about 2 billion lines of code. To put this in perspective, a military drone has about 3.5 million lines of code. Google is always changing and adapting to user needs. They’re improving existing products and releasing new ones to please subscribers and retain marketshare. The 2 billion lines of code that make our lives easier are constantly getting better. In fact, Google has about 25,000 engineers working on that code everyday. They are collaborating to make the products we know and love.

        25,000 engineers collaborating in one huge code repository sounds like a logistical nightmare. Could one sleep-deprived, grumpy developer make a single tiny mistake and take down the one thing (Google Hangouts) getting millions of Millennials through the workday? Is there a conference room large enough to house 25,000 developers working on the same project each day? Are thousands of man-hours wasted in duplicative work each day due to communication lapses across the 25,000 code maestros? Thankfully for us and for Google, there’s git.

        Git is a version control software. Version control allows an individual to work on and change code while saving versions of that code along the way. So if an engineer makes a mistake writing code that relates to Google’s new logo, he can return to a previous version of the code. In addition, git props users to save notes on each change they make describing what the change was intended to do or fix. Git and version control software work on the local level - meaning that changes are tracked within an individual’s terminal. Tracking changes is all well and good but for a company like Google with 25,000 engineers making approximately 45,000 commits to 2 billion lines of code each day, every single programmer needs access to real time code updates and explanations of that code.

      GitHub is a website that takes git changes tracked by an users terminal locally and brings it online for others to collaborate. (Although Google doesn’t use GitHub specifically, they use something very similar to manage changes). GitHub keeps all of the engineers working on code up to date with changes. All of the changes git commits from an engineer’s terminal now become available for collaborators. No one needs to book a 25,000 person conference room and Millennials can continue their Google Hangouts during work hours thanks to collaborative open source sites like GitHub. Knowledge can be shared and a huge number of collaborators can work towards creating the best new Google product without being in the same room. Engineers can double check each other’s work to make sure mistakes aren’t present and if they are, git version control let’s them erase the mistake and revert back to a previous version.

      Rome wasn’t built in a day and Gmail wasn’t coded by one lonely engineer. Version control, git and GitHub all work together to promote innovation and collaboration. It takes a lot of brains working together efficiently to create a tech empire.
