  A class in Ruby can be thought of as a blueprint. The class is like a controlled environment for a program. You can define a class and then make certain rules to go along with that class. Let's say that we're writing a program that tells us if we have enough ingredients for certain items. The first step is to create a class: my_kitchen. We do this because we're going to define variables and methods based on what I have.</p>
<p>
Instance variables are really important when working in classes. An instance variable is a variable that has a set value that remains intact throughout the class. Let's say I want to set up some core ingredients values up in my program. For example, I have 10 eggs. This is a fact. In my kitchen right now, I have 10 eggs. The value of eggs will remain constant throughout my program. Instead of defining the number of eggs I have in each method I create, I can make it an instance variable in the begining of the program and continue to use eggs as I go!</p>
