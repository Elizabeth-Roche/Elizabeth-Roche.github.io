      When writing HTML, we often find ourselves using the same elements over and over again. This is great because later on, we can take all of the h1 content and make it bold with one swift CSS call. What happens when we don't want the content in every paragraph tag formatted the exact same way? Maybe you want to distinguish quoted paragraphs from your own using italics. Luckily, there's an easy way to do that!

      Classes and ids are useful ways to describe content that we can target later for styling in CSS. Instead of being limited to just formatting an element uniformly, you can add an id or a class to style individual elements.

      Classes and ids are great but knowing when to use each one is even MORE great. The thing to remember is that ids are unique! Each element can only have one id and each page can only have one element with that id. So if you want to style a specific paragraph on a page and you know that you want that paragraph to have a unique styling -- different from all of the others, use an id! Classes on the other hand, are not unique. You can use the same class on multiple elements and you can use that class multiple times on the same page. For example, if you have several quoted paragraphs on a page and you'd like to style them uniformly but differentiate them from the rest of your paragraphs, you'd use a class hook!
