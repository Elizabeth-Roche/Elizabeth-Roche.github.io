   <h2>Rails: Some History</h2>
    <p>
      You've probably heard of Rails before or maybe you've heard of Ruby on Rails. Either way, if you're anything like me, you might be wondering what Rails is all about. We know that Ruby is a programming language and we know that many people use Ruby because it's user friendly, great for beginners and has tons of built in methods to make coding easier and more efficient. So what does it mean to have Ruby on Rails?
    </p>

    <p>
      Rails is an open source web framework that uses Ruby as its programming language. It was initially created in 2003 as a byproduct of Basecamp (a project management software) by a guy named David Heinemeier Hansson or DHH. A year later, he extracted the source and then released an open source project that would eventually be the first release of Ruby on Rails. Two years later, Apple bundled Rails with OSX Leopard and it's been a popular framework for developers ever since.

    <h2>Rails: Created with Two Main Conventions</h2>
    <p>
      Rails is revolutionary and soared in popularity because it makes web development quick an easy. How does it do this? Well, our friend DHH built Rails with two main things in mind. The first is convention over configuration or CoC. What does this mean? It means that Rails has built in behaviors and Rails defaults to the best way of doing things. Let's say you're building a website - Rails uses built in behaviors to make assumptions about what you need to get started. This allows you to write less code and create websites faster than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second main convention of Rails is "Don't Repeat Yourself" or DRY. DRY goes along with the idea of many implicit behaviors being built into Rails. Because Rails is going to default to the best way of doing things, the developer doesn't have to specify what to do, therefore reducing reptition and allowing for rapid development.
    </p>

  <h2>Rails: Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework. The model is the central component of the framework. You can think of the model as the rule book and the dictionary. It manages the logic/rules of an application and can talk to the database to validate data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The V or view in MVC refers to a template that renders data from the model and presents to the user. The view can be any output that displays logic/data from the model. It might be a chart, spreadsheet or graph. The C or controller is the piece of the puzzle that sits between the user and the model. The C can take requests and then pass them along to the model. You can think of this process like a cycle. The user gives a command to the controller. The controller passes the command to the model. The model passes the command to the view to display the output requested by the user. Pretty neat!
