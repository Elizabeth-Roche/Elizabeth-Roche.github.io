<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was helpful to walk through wireframing with my pair.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
The wireframe process was extremely helpful to my development process. It was nice to have a map to work from.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? We talked about keeping everything in the wireframe organized with divs and making sure all of the indents were uniform. This way, we can adjust it later if need be. We decided that a simple wireframe that focuses on the function was the way to go.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? I learned more about div and article tags-->
