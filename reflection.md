What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I think I learned the most about padding. Padding is interesting because it becomes part of the element it's around as opposed to a margin which remains separate from the element. Playing around with padding and essentially making elements "larger" by adding padding was interesting. I continued to learn about borders and used borders in order to underline certain elements.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
To be honest, I'm still having trouble understanding positioning and how it really impacts elements. I attempted to experiment with different types of positioning to see what they did in different uses but wasn't really understanding the the application of each different position. After a while, I found I wasn't getting anywhere so I moved on.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Font and colors are probably the easiest. The hardest part for me is that I don't really have any design ideas. Everything I outlined in wireframe was pretty basic because I didn't have any other ideas. Positioning, padding, and margins continue to be challenging for me.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that I need a lot more practice with this. I also learned the importance of having organized HTML so you can create a stylesheet that does exactly what you want it to.s
