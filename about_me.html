  <h1>About me!</h1>
  <h2 id="main">Dog mom, ice hockey enthusiast, foodie, traveler, and home cook</h2>
<p>Thanks for dropping by! I'm originally from a small town in Fairfield County Connecticut and attended Skidmore College in upstate New York. I studied Government and Anthropology. After graduating in 2011, I took a leap and moved to Chicago - my current home. I started doing sales for a large startup and continued my sales career at LinkedIn. </p>

<p>In October of 2015, I welcomed my French Bulldog companion Tinkerbell into my life. We're best buds and enjoy exploring the city every chance we get! I'm a connoisseur of dog friendly establishments and when the weather permits, we can be found soaking up rays on a dog-friendly patio.</p>
